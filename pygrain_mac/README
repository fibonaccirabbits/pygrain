Short guide to pyGRAIN.

Notice:
-------
pyGRAIN works only on linux (pygrain_lnx) and mac (pygrain_mac) machines. 
please provide read, write and execute permissions to the main program pygrain.py and
to the directory infiles by running the following in a linux terminal (assuming
you are in a pygrain directory):

chmod 755 pygrain.py
chmod 755 infiles/*

Prerequisite:
-------------
1.DSSP
2.GROMACS 5.0 and above (uses the new gmx syntax)
3.prot.pdb file(s) stored in distinct directory(ies) within the models directory,
  eg. models/1/prot.pdb, models/2/prot.pdb

IMPORTANT: 
mac users please install DSSP and GROMACS through Fink (http://www.finkproject.org)


How to use:
-------------------

1. Atomisitic to coarse grained represenation.
---------------------------------------------
To convert  atomistic files to their coresponding coarse grained
representations run the prepare1.py script:

python prepare1.py

The script looks for prot.pdb files in models directory. It converts all
prot.pdb files found in models directory to prot_cg.pdb,  embed the protein
in a DPPC bilayer and creates the coresponding .itp, .top, .ssp, and .gro
files. This step utilizes martini and insane. 


2. Minimization and equilibration.
----------------------------------
To add ions and to perform minimizations, NVT and NPT  run the
prepare2.py script.

python prepare2.py

This sript looks for system.gor file in models directory and performs the
procedures above sequentially. This step utilizes GROMACS


3. Reseting models.
-------------------
To reset models run the reset.py script.

python reset.py

This script keeps the prot.pdb file and removes the rest.
