Short guide to pyGRAIN.

Notice:
-------
pyGRAIN works only on linux machines. 
please provides read, write and execute permission to the script pygrain.py and
to the directry infiles by running the following in a linux terminal (assuming
you are in pygrain directory):

chmod 755 pygrain.py
chmod 755 infiles/*

Prerequisite:
-------------
DSSP
GROMACS 5.0 and above (uses the new gmx syntax)
prot.pdb file(s) stored in distinct directory(ies) within the models directory,
eg. models/1/prot.pdb, models/2/prot.pdb

1. Atomisitic to coarse grained represenation.
---------------------------------------------
To convert  atomistic files to their coresponding coarse grained representation
run the prepare1.py script:

python prepare1.py

The script looks for prot.pdb files in models directory. It converts all
prot.pdb files found in models directory to prot_cg.pdb and also produces 
the coresponding .itp, .top, .ssp, and .gro files. 


2. Minimization and equilibration.
----------------------------------
To perform minimizations and equilibrations (using gromacs), run the
prepare2.py script

python prepare2.py
